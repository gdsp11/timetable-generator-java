TO-DO:
    must find a way to create a week's table to contain all shifts and by whom they are taken
        * this will also contain a method to create a random timetable based on availability
            and number of hours remaining
    must also implement a PERSONAL timetable:
        - one to contain the availability   DONE
        - one to contain the shifts taken
            * this timetable will also be the one to tell us the total of hours

ADDITIONAL:
    memorize employees in files with their names and ID
    save/replace the week's timetable to a file
    create a GUI:
        - show employees
        - show timetable in a nice format, instead of console
        - add/remove employees
        - rebuild timetable
